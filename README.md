The paper uses the natural setting of cricket to test theoretical predictions in game
theory. In this setting, the agents play a one-shot-two-person constant sum game. The paper
assesses whether trained professionals in cricket follow the "mix" of strategies predicted by
Nash equilibria. The test uses a unique dataset derived from commentary data comprising of
bowler and batsman strategies and outcomes. The paper creates a model for bowler-bastman
interactions in cricket and uses this in conjunction with the data to generate predicted Nash
equilibrium frequencies. These predicted frequencies are then compared with the actual
frequencies from the data. My study finds that players follow equilibrium play when we
consider a model with simplified strategy sets, that is, their predicted Nash frequencies of
strategies are within two standard deviations of the actual frequencies. However, the paper
finds that equilibrium play is not followed when the strategy sets in the model are made
more elaborate. The findings of the study are important because it provides evidence of
equilibrium play even if it is in the simplified setting. Furthermore, this paper can be used to
provide strategy implications for cricket players.
